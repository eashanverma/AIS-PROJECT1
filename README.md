Now-a-days it's been a big challenge for conservation of the water as nearly 80% of the water present on the earth is used for agricultural purpose. As population is increasing day by day, the demand for food never dies and so some smart technologies have been implemented for the better agricultural growth. Considering the electronics region, many smart projects have been implemented for agricultural purpose and one of them is A Low-Cost Arduino based Automatic Irrigation System using soil moisture sensor. It automatically turns ON/OFF depending on the conditions of the soil. If the soil is in dry condition, then the motor turns ON automatically and in case if it is in Wet condition, then it automatically gets turned OFF. An Automatic Irrigation system not only turns ON/OFF depending on the soil conditions but also reduces the human interference and human labour towards the work. It also saves the time and also the water as excess water leads to damage of the crops. During summers, a great many people are as well languid to water the pruned plants on their roof gardens consistently. In the realm of advance gadgets life of individuals ought to be less complex thus to make life less complex and advantageous, so I have made "Automatic Irrigation System".
